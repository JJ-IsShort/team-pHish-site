# Message to Reader
We want to bring your attention to a critical but often overlooked threat to our environment and communities: ocean acidification through this site. According to the World Meteorological Organization, rising carbon dioxide emissions are lowering the pH of our oceans. This shift threatens coral reefs, which are not only vital ecosystems but also natural barriers that protect our coastlines. We urge anyone reading to be aware and prioritize UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. Specifically, SDG Target 14.3, which emphasizes the importance of monitoring and reducing ocean acidification. Stronger measures to reduce CO₂ emissions and protect reef ecosystems are essential to safeguard both marine biodiversity and human safety. Protecting ocean health is not only about the survival of coral reefs—it is about resilience, security, and the well-being of future generations.

# What is pH?
pH is a scale used to measure the acidity of water. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being extremely acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being extremely alkaline, or not acidic. pH is measured using the Universal indicator, which is a mixture of different indicators of dyes that have different color changes showing the pH value of a solution. For reference, the pH of battery acid is 1, the pH of tap water is 7, and the pH of bleach is 14. A less accurate way to measure pH is through the use of litmus paper. Red litmus paper turns blue in Alkaline conditions and stays red in acidic conditions. Blue litmus paper turns red in acidic solutions and stays blue in alkaline solutions. 

# Effects of Ocean Acidity
The effects of ocean acidity on the environment and everyday life are widespread. It poses a particular risk to marine life with shells. The increased acidity reduces carbonate ion availability, increasing the difficulty of forming and maintaining shells. The acidity also causes shells to dissolve and weaken, affecting a vital part of the marine ecosystem. Coral reefs also depend on the calcium carbonate skeletons, and as ocean pH drops they grow slower and are more prone to erosion or bleaching. Coral reefs are home to thousands of marine species, and their demise would be terrible for the ocean's ecosystem. Some species of small plankton also rely on calcium carbonate, and they are at the base of the food chain. Their decline affects fish populations and other marine animals that rely on them for food, causing ripples up the food chain. Finally, the change in ocean chemistry also impacts the ocean ability to absorb CO2, impacting the entire globe and worsening global warming.

# How Does This Happen?
Ocean acidity increases as more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves into seawater. When CO2 enters the ocean, it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid, which then breaks apart into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate. The rise in hydrogens lowers the pH of the water, making it more acidic. These hydrogen ions then combine with carbonate ions, reducing the availability for marine organisms mentioned before. As humans release CO2, more of it dissolves into the ocean, forming additional carbonic acid and accelerating acidification.

# How Can You Help?
While ocean acidification may seem like a large scale issue, every individual can make a difference by reducing their personal carbon footprint and supporting sustainable practices. Simple changes like turning off the lights, making sure to unplug electronics, and finding energy efficient appliances can cut down energy waste. Choosing to walk, bike, or ever share a ride with friends helps to cut down CO2 emissions.Making these changes protect marine life and coral reefs. Supporting and spreading awareness for UN Sustainable Development Goal 14, especially Target 14.3, moves the efforts to reduce ocean acidification forward.
